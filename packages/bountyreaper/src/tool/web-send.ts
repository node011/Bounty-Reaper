// The ONE core request-sender every target-facing tool routes through.
//
// It composes the three layers that must agree on every outbound attack request —
// network policy (Network.forUrl: proxy, extra CA, client cert, TLS strictness),
// governance (Send.governed: retry / circuit-breaker / budget), and the transport
// (BackendFetch, which stays pure and takes only primitive fields) — and adds the
// proxy-aware error/status framing. Because http_replay AND inject_probe (and any
// future sender) all call this, a change here — a new proxy behaviour, a TLS rule,
// an auth step, an observability hook — reaches every tool at once. Nothing about a
// send that should be identical across tools belongs in the tools themselves.
//
// The per-tool concerns (which credential, how to observe the response, mutations /
// payload batteries) stay in the tools; only the act of putting one request on the
// wire lives here.
