// It reads `network` from the config and resolves it PER DESTINATION, because
// two of the rules are destination-dependent: the bypass list, and per-host
// client certificates.
//
// Deliberate non-goals:
//   - No env vars, no global agent, no process-wide side effects. Callers pass
//     what they get from here explicitly, so anything that does NOT ask stays
//     unproxied — which is how loopback ingest keeps working for free.
//   - The replay backends stay pure: they accept these options, they never read
//     config themselves (they are unit-tested with no network and no Instance).
