# Interceptor — signed-in browser sessions

## When to use Interceptor vs other browser tools

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Crawl / discover URLs at scale | `katana`, `hakrawler`, `gospider` — NEVER Interceptor |
| Headless render + login-flow validation of a specific page | `mcpbrowser` |
| **Use the operator's ACTUAL signed-in browser session** (existing cookies, profiles, 2FA-complete logins) | **`interceptor`** |
| **Passive traffic inspection of a live page** (fetch/XHR/SSE/WebSocket/Beacon/BroadcastChannel, headers) | **`interceptor`** |
| Native macOS app / iOS automation | `interceptor` (Full install only; this is a browser-only install) |

Interceptor works through the operator's own Chrome/Brave via an extension — cookies,
sessions, and SSO logins already exist. That is its unique value; automation tools that
spawn a fresh browser cannot replicate it.

## Setup (once per machine)

The extension must be loaded in Chrome/Brave and the daemon running. Native messaging
manifests live under `/Library/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/` — if commands fail
to connect, that manifest is missing (root install step; see install notes in the
repo's docs). Verify health:

```bash
interceptor status        # daemon + transport state
interceptor contexts      # connected browser profiles
```

## Core commands

```bash
# Open a managed tab (background) and read its structure
interceptor open "https://target.com/account" --group hunt-1
interceptor read --group hunt-1

# Find and act by element reference (refs come from read/find)
interceptor find "Sign in" --group hunt-1
interceptor act <ref> --group hunt-1          # click
interceptor act <ref> "text" --group hunt-1   # type

# Inspect page traffic passively (no debugger attach)
interceptor inspect --group hunt-1

# Cleanup when done — closes the task's managed tabs
interceptor group close hunt-1
```

Multiple concurrent workers: give each its own `--group`; each browser profile is a
`--context` (run `interceptor contexts` to list).

## Pentest-specific plays

1. **Authenticated surface walk (signed-in session):** operator's session is already
   logged in — `open` → `read` → map account settings, hidden admin links, role-gated
   UI. Evidence for authz testing (pair with the IDOR/authz methodology).
2. **Passive traffic capture:** `inspect` reveals internal API routes the SPA calls
   (endpoints, params, auth headers) that crawlers miss — feed them into `add_intel`
   and http_replay testing.
3. **DOM XSS verification:** load a page in the real session, then verify
   hash/postMessage payloads execute (capture console) — stronger proof than curl.
4. **Same-origin fetches from the session:** combine with CORS/postMessage analysis —
   the operator's cookies ride along, exactly what a cross-origin attacker gets.

## Boundaries (hard rules)

- NEVER use Interceptor for bulk crawling — it drives the operator's real browser and
  tabs; that is the mcpbrowser/katana boundary, not a capacity question.
- One `--group` per logical task; close groups when done (`group close`).
- Actions run in the operator's accounts: destructive UI actions (delete, transfer,
  purchase) require explicit user authorization on the record first — same gate as any
  active testing.
- All traffic inspection is passive; never exfiltrate page data anywhere except the
  operator's evidence store.
